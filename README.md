## Air Quality Index Prediction
This model detects the level of pollution based on given atmospheric values obtained through Web Scraping .
It predicts the value for a particular date using various machine learning algorithims and was  deployed on Heroku.
Some of algorithims are-
1.Random forest
2.Decision Tree
3.XGBoost
